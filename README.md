- Version Control System:
    Management of changes performed in a file, document, code or any piece of 
    information. 
    
    Simply put, It's a way to track our code changes, allowing us to save our initial
    version of the code, update the code by committing changes directly into the code in real time. We can hop back to previous versions, allows us to check for bugs/errors. 

## Difference between Git and Github:
